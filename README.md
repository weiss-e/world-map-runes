# World Map Runes v0.1.3
Displays the runes required for all spell teleport destinations on the world map underneath the existing tooltip.

Works with all spellbooks. Compatible with everything including the default World Map plugin.

This plugin is essentially a modified (and heavily stripped down) version of the WorldMap plugin created by Morgan Lewis (https://github.com/MESLewis) so special thanks goes out to them.

**TODO**: Find a way to render images in the icon tooltip (or create a custom tooltip altogether) so that I can display the runes required with actual icons.

Open to suggestions.
